## Note about support for this library

This library was made for the Bluesky Social App. Support for this library is very much dependent on two factors:

- Do we have time to implement a feature or fix an issue?
- How important is the feature to Bluesky or does it fix an issue present in Bluesky?

If there are features that you want to see in this library that don't already exist and likely (or definitely) do not greatly improve the experience in Bluesky, please feel free to submit a PR! Of course, you should also feel free to make feature suggestions or bug reports as well, and whenever free time is available they might be worked on. Just know it might take some time.

Thank you!
